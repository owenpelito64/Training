**Factories & seeders**

- Laravel model factories and seeders make it painless to create test database records using your application's Eloquent models and relationships.

**Seeders**

- To generate a seeder, execute the make:seeder Artisan command. All seeders generated by the framework will be placed in the database/seeders directory:

- A seeder class only contains one method by default: run. This method is called when the db:seed Artisan command is executed. Within the run method, you may insert data into your database however you wish.

```

php artisan make:seeder UsersTableSeeder


```

```php

 public function run()
    {
        DB::table('users')->insert([
            'name' => Str::random(10),
            'email' => Str::random(10).'@gmail.com',
            'password' => Hash::make('password'),
        ]);
```

**Running Seeders**

```php

php artisan db:seed

php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder


php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
// drop all tables and re-run all of your migrations
```

**Factory**

- Manually specifying the attributes for each model seed is cumbersome. Instead, you can use model factories to conveniently generate large amounts of database records.

```php

use App\Models\User;

/**
 * Run the database seeders.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function run()
{
    User::factory()
            ->count(50)
            ->hasPosts(1)
            ->create();
}

```

**Calling Additional Seeders**

- Within the DatabaseSeeder class, you may use the call method to execute additional seed classes. Using the call method allows you to break up your database seeding into multiple files so that no single seeder class becomes too large. The call method accepts an array of seeder classes that should be executed:

```php

public function run()
{
    $this->call([
        UserSeeder::class,
        PostSeeder::class,
        CommentSeeder::class,
    ]);
}

```
