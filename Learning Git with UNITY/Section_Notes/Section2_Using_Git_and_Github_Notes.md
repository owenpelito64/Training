//OVERVIEW of the process repositories
People Rarely Incinerate Red Porcupine.
Project -> Repo -> Ignore -> Remote -> Push.

Ignore - Only storing what needed to store. think of the files you want to ignore and not ignore.
example of ignoring files:
1.Private data such as database etc.
2.Assets that doesn't need to be track such as:images,clips,icons etc.

Repo - Start tracking the changes from the project.means putting a folder within your project that is called .git
Pushing - Sending project to the web with the HISTORY.
Staging - is the next stage towards commiting.
