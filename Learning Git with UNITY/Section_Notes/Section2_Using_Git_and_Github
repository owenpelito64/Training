//OVERVIEW of the process repositories
People Rarely Incinerate Red Porcupine.
Project -> Repo -> Ignore -> Remote -> Push.

Ignore - Only storing what needed to store. think of the files you want to ignore and not ignore.

example of ignoring files:
1.Private data such as database etc.
2.Assets that doesn't need to be track such as:images,clips,icons etc.

Repo - means putting a folder within your project that is called .git
Pushing - Sending project to the web with the HISTORY.

Staging - is the next stage towards commiting.

//SIDE NOTES
Github Limitation - 100mb single file limit. - you can't do lock asset.

Bookmarks - thing will open when you close sourcetree

!important - dont mess with .git folder it can break thing. you can delete it to delete histories.
