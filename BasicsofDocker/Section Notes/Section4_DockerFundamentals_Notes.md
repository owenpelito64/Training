**Stable**

- Year-month releases are made from a release branch diverged from the master branch. The branch is created with format <year>.<month>, for example 20.10. The year-month name indicates the earliest possible calendar month to expect the release to be generally available. All further patch releases are performed from that branch. For example, once v20.10.0 is released, all subsequent patch releases are built from the 20.10 branch.

**Test**

- In preparation for a new year-month release, a branch is created from the master branch with format YY.mm when the milestones desired by Docker for the release have achieved feature-complete. Pre-releases such as betas and release candidates are conducted from their respective release branches. Patch releases and the corresponding pre-releases are performed from within the corresponding release branch.

**Nightly**

- Nightly builds give you the latest builds of work in progress for the next major release. They are created once per day from the master branch with the version format:
